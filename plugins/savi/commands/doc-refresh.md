# /doc-refresh — Refresh Conceptual Documentation

Update an existing documentation file to reflect the current state of the code it documents.

## Arguments

**`$ARGUMENTS`**: Path to the documentation file to refresh

- **Doc file path** (required) - The markdown file to update (e.g., `docs/api-architecture.md`, `src/api/README.md`)

Examples:
```
/doc-refresh docs/api-architecture.md
/doc-refresh src/parser/README.md
```

## What This Command Does

Re-reads the source code that a documentation file describes, then updates the documentation to reflect the current state.

**Key principles:**
- **Snapshot, not changelog**: Write as if documenting fresh, never say "changed from X to Y"
- **No recency bias**: Don't overweight recent changes over the overall system
- **Preserve spirit**: Maintain the conceptual focus and style of the original
- **Same structure**: Keep the original document organization

## Phase 1: Read Existing Documentation

Read the documentation file specified in `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Phase 2: Parse Metadata

Look for the "Generation Metadata" section at the end of the document.

**Expected format:**
```markdown
## Generation Metadata

**Generated by:** `/doc` command
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last refreshed:** YYYY-MM-DD (via `/doc-refresh`)  [May not be present on first refresh]
**Source paths:**
- path/to/file1
- path/to/folder/

**Additional context:** [Context from original generation]
```

Extract:
- **Source paths** - What files/folders to re-examine
- **Additional context** - Any clarifying info from original generation

**If metadata is missing or malformed:**
- Read through the document content carefully
- Infer what files/folders it's documenting from:
  - File paths mentioned in the text
  - Component/module names referenced
  - Code snippets or examples shown
- Continue with those inferred paths

## Phase 3: Re-explore Source Code

Read the current state of all source paths:
- For **folders**: Use Glob to find files, Grep to understand structure, Read key files
- For **files**: Read the file(s) and related context

Understand:
- What has stayed the same since the doc was written
- What has evolved or changed
- New components or concepts that emerged
- Deprecated or removed elements

## Phase 4: Update Documentation

Rewrite the documentation to reflect the current state.

### Critical Guidelines

**✓ DO:**
- Describe the system as it is today
- Maintain the same conceptual level and focus as the original
- Keep the same document structure (sections, organization)
- Preserve the writing style and tone
- Update any outdated information or examples

**✗ DO NOT:**
- Use changelog language ("This used to be X, now it's Y")
- Say "previously" or "originally" or "was changed to"
- Overweight recent changes (avoid recency bias)
- Turn the doc into a timeline or history
- Add implementation details if the original was high-level
- Change the focus or purpose of the documentation

### Example Comparisons

**Bad (changelog mentality):**
> The authentication system was originally based on sessions, but has been changed to use JWT tokens. Previously, we stored user data in the session, but now we encode it in the token payload.

**Good (snapshot mentality):**
> The authentication system uses JWT tokens. User identification data is encoded in the token payload, allowing stateless authentication across services.

**Bad (recency bias):**
> The system has four main components. The newest addition is the caching layer, which was recently added to improve performance...

**Good (balanced current state):**
> The system has four main components: the request handler, data processor, caching layer, and response formatter. The caching layer improves performance by...

## Phase 5: Update Metadata & Save

Update the metadata section:

```markdown
## Generation Metadata

**Generated by:** `/doc` command
**Date:** [Original date, preserved]
**Last refreshed:** [Today's date] (via `/doc-refresh`)
**Source paths:**
- [Same paths as before, or corrected if wrong]

**Additional context:** [Original context, preserved]
```

Overwrite the original documentation file with the updated content.

Confirm to the user:
```
Documentation refreshed: `[path/to/doc.md]`
```

## Phase 6: Summary

Provide a brief 2-3 sentence summary of what was updated, without going into detailed changes. Focus on scope, not specifics.

**Example:**
```
Refreshed the API architecture documentation. The core conceptual model remains the same, with updates to reflect the current module structure and component relationships.
```

## Important Notes

- **Preserve original intent**: The goal is to keep the doc current, not to rewrite it
- **Maintain quality**: If the original doc was high-quality conceptual writing, match that level
- **Avoid over-updating**: If nothing significant changed, minimal updates are appropriate
- **No recency bias**: Recent changes aren't inherently more important than older stable code

## Examples

### Example 1: Refresh API documentation
```
/doc-refresh docs/api-architecture.md
```
Re-reads the API source code, updates the documentation to reflect current state.

### Example 2: Refresh module README
```
/doc-refresh src/parser/README.md
```
Updates the parser module documentation based on current implementation.
