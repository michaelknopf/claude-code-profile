# /doc — Generate Conceptual Documentation

Create high-level conceptual documentation for a file or folder, focusing on the "why" rather than the "what" or "how to use".

## Arguments

**`$ARGUMENTS`**: Target path and optional output location

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **Target path** (required) - File or folder to document (e.g., `src/api/`, `lib/parser.py`)
- **`--output=<file>`** (optional) - Specific output location (e.g., `--output=docs/api.md`)

Examples:
```
/doc src/api/
/doc lib/parser.py --output=docs/parsing-architecture.md
/doc plugins/savi/commands/
```

## What This Command Creates

**This is NOT:**
- A usage guide or manual
- An API reference
- A function/class index
- A code walkthrough
- A duplicate of information that lives in the code itself (enum lists, directory structures, class definitions)

**This IS:**
- A conceptual explanation of purpose and motivation
- High-level architectural overview
- Explanation of key abstractions and how they fit together
- Design decisions and their rationale
- Links to relevant source files for implementation details

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
1. **Target path** (required) - What to document
2. **Output location** (optional) - If `--output=<file>` is present, use that path

## Phase 2: Explore Target

Read and understand the code:
- For **folders**: Use Glob to find relevant files, Grep to understand structure, Read key files
- For **files**: Read the file(s) and related context
- Understand: purpose, responsibilities, key abstractions, relationships with other components

## Phase 3: Brief & Clarify

Present your understanding to the user and ask clarifying questions.

**Template:**
```
I've explored [target]. Here's my understanding:

[2-3 paragraph summary of what you learned]

Questions before I write the documentation:
1. [Clarifying question about purpose/scope]
2. [Question about any ambiguous design decisions]
3. [Question about audience or focus areas]
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather responses.

## Phase 4: Determine Output Location

**If `--output` was specified:** Use that path exactly.

**If no `--output` specified:** Choose the best location based on context.

Options:
1. **Adjacent to target** - Co-locate with what's being documented
   - For self-contained modules/packages
   - Example: `src/api/` → `src/api/README.md` or `src/api/API.md`

2. **Centralized docs folder** - Place in `docs/` directory
   - For cross-cutting concerns
   - For high-level architectural documentation
   - If project already has similar docs in `docs/`
   - Example: `src/api/` → `docs/api-architecture.md`

**Important:** Never use `docs/notes/` (typically gitignored)

Choose a descriptive filename that reflects the content:
- `README.md` for module overviews
- `[Component].md` for specific components (e.g., `API.md`, `Parser.md`)
- `[topic]-[aspect].md` for focused docs (e.g., `auth-architecture.md`)

## Phase 5: Write Document

### Structure and Organization

**Think carefully about structure.** Don't force a rigid template. Instead, consider:
- What mental model would most help someone understand this?
- What's the natural progression from "I know nothing" to "I understand how this works"?
- What sections would make this most scannable and navigable?

**Common patterns** (use what fits, skip what doesn't):
- **Purpose/Overview**: Why this exists, what problem it solves
- **Key Concepts**: Core abstractions and mental models
- **Architecture/How It Works**: How pieces fit together
- **Design Decisions**: Important choices and trade-offs
- **Examples/Illustrations**: Concrete scenarios that clarify abstract concepts

Let the content guide the structure. A data pipeline might benefit from a "Data Flow" section. A state machine might need "State Transitions." An integration layer might need "Contracts and Boundaries."

### Document Format

```markdown
# [Module/Component Name]

> **Note:** This document provides conceptual explanations with illustrative code examples. For current implementation details, refer to the linked source files. Examples may evolve over time.

[Your thoughtfully structured content here]

## Generation Metadata

**Generated by:** `/doc` command
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Source paths:**
- [path/to/file1]
- [path/to/folder/]

**Additional context:** [Any clarifying information from user Q&A, or "None" if no additional context]
```

### Writing Guidelines

**Audience:**
Write for someone who has just joined the project and is trying to orient themselves. They need to understand where this fits, why it exists, and how it works conceptually before diving into the code. Help them build the right mental model.

**Content:**
- **Focus on "why" over "what"**: Explain purpose and rationale, not implementation details
- **Minimal code snippets**: Only include code if it helps explain a concept, not as examples of usage
- **High-level**: Stay at the conceptual/architectural level, avoid line-by-line explanations
- **Self-sufficient**: Document should be understandable without reading the code
- **Avoid instruction**: This is not a "how to use" guide

### Code Duplication Guidelines

**Link to code, don't copy it:**
- Instead of inlining full enum lists, class definitions, or config structures, provide a few illustrative examples and link to the source file
- Example: "The system recognizes 22 entity types including PHONE_NUMBER, EMAIL, and CRYPTO_ADDRESS. See `src/models/entities.py` for the complete list."

**Examples, not exhaustive lists:**
- When showing examples (enum values, entity types, etc.), show 2-4 illustrative ones
- Always note that examples may evolve and link to source for the current full list
- Example: "Lure types include URGENCY, FINANCIAL_GAIN, and THREAT. See `src/models/behavioral.py` for all types."

**Never include directory structures:**
- Directory tree listings are maintenance nightmares and duplicate what's visible in the file tree
- If you need to reference file locations, mention specific paths in text or link directly

**When code snippets ARE appropriate:**
- Explaining a concept that requires seeing the structure (e.g., how state flows through a system)
- Showing a stable interface/contract that's central to understanding
- The code is unlikely to change frequently
- Always include a disclaimer that examples are illustrative

## Phase 6: Save

Write the document to the chosen/specified location.

Confirm to the user:
```
Documentation created at: `[path/to/output.md]`
```

## Important Notes

- **Must include metadata section**: The `/doc-refresh` command relies on this to update the doc later
- **Be judicious with location choice**: Consider project structure and existing documentation patterns
- **Ask questions**: Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify before writing - better to confirm than assume

## Examples

### Example 1: Document a folder
```
/doc src/api/
```
Explores the API module, asks clarifying questions, generates documentation at either `src/api/README.md` or `docs/api-architecture.md` depending on context.

### Example 2: Document a specific file with custom output
```
/doc lib/parser.py --output=docs/parser-design.md
```
Documents the parser module, saves to specified location.

### Example 3: Document the commands folder itself
```
/doc plugins/savi/commands/
```
Generates conceptual documentation explaining the command system architecture.
